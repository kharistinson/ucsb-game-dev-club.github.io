Spellball is a variant of the _Pong_ game in which each player controls a wizard
and attempts to defeat the other player's wizard. This is achieved by
controlling a paddle and deflecting the ball onto the opponent's wizard or side,
with a hit to the opponent's wizard doing more "damage". Each player can place
an enchantment on their wizard's paddle, which will grant the ball one of two
special effects when the ball hits the paddle: ice moves more slowly but does
more damage, and lightning moves quickly but does less damage.

## Playing

The game is packaged for the web browser, so no special software is needed to
install the game. Simply download and extract the zip file, and then open
`spellball.html` in your favorite web browser.

Spellball has both a player-vs-player mode and a player-vs-AI mode (the AI is
very simple).

## About the creation of the game

Spellball was created by Bryan Tan for one of the assignments in CMPTGCS 130H,
the Video Game Design and Implementation course taught by Richert Wang, in
Spring 2018. It uses Godot Engine as the game engine. The art assets were
downloaded from OpenGameArt (the list of assets used is located within the game
itself).
