# UCSB's Game Development Club Website

This contains the source content for UCSB's Game Development Club website. We
use [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) as a static site generator.

## Contributing

Make sure you have `hugo` and `git` installed. Once you have them both
installed, open a terminal (`cmd` on Windows) and run

```plain
git clone https://github.com/ucsb-game-dev-club/ucsb-game-dev-club.github.io.git
cd ucsb-game-dev-club.github.io
```

to copy the website. Retrieve the latest changes with

```plain
git pull
```

Then you can run a local version of the website with

```plain
hugo serve -D
```

which can navigate to by entering `http://localhost:1313` in your web browser.
It will update as you edit the content on the website.
